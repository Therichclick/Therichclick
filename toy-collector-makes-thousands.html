    <p>Meet James, a former warehouse worker from Ohio who turned his love for nostalgia into a money-making machine. After stumbling on a $2 Star Wars figure that sold for $89 on eBay, he was hooked.</p>

    <h2>How He Got Started</h2>
    <p>James began scouring garage sales, thrift stores, and Facebook Marketplace for undervalued vintage toys â€” action figures, board games, and even Happy Meal toys from the '90s.</p>

    <h2>The Strategy</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Buy low, list high with strong photos and descriptions</li>
      <li>Use eBay sold listings to price accurately</li>
      <li>Bundle items into themed lots for faster sales</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Results</h2>
    <p>In under 9 months, James profited over $12,000. Most of his sales came from international buyers and niche collectors.</p>

    <h2>Pro Tips</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Condition matters: mint-in-box toys get top dollar</li>
      <li>Shipping overseas? Always factor in tracking and customs</li>
      <li>Keep an inventory spreadsheet to avoid overselling</li>
    </ul>
