<h1 style="color: #2c3e50;">💡 From Stay-at-Home Mom to Etsy Star – Her $10K/Month Canva Side Hustle 💡</h1>

<p><strong style="color: #e67e22;">Meet Sarah</strong>, a 32-year-old stay-at-home mom from Ohio who turned her hobby into a digital goldmine. Just a year ago, she was googling <span style="color: #2980b9;">"how to make money online from home"</span> and stumbled across the world of <strong>Etsy printables</strong>.</p>

<p>With zero graphic design experience, Sarah started using <strong>Canva</strong> (yes, the free version!) to create simple planners, habit trackers, and kids' chore charts. Her first listing? A pastel morning routine chart – it didn’t blow up overnight, but it got traction. 💥</p>

<h2 style="color: #8e44ad;">🚀 The Viral Boost</h2>
<p>Three months in, one of her <strong>self-care planner bundles</strong> was picked up by a YouTuber reviewing digital products on Etsy. <span style="color: #27ae60;"><strong>Sales skyrocketed!</strong></span> Sarah went from a few bucks a day to $400+ daily within a week. That video alone drove over 10,000 visitors to her shop!</p>

<h2 style="color: #d35400;">🎯 Her Winning Strategy</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong style="color: #3498db;">SEO-Optimized Titles:</strong> She used tools like eRank to find keywords like "daily digital planner for moms." 📈</li>
  <li><strong style="color: #9b59b6;">Niche Focus:</strong> Instead of trying everything, she focused on wellness planners and kids' products. 🎯</li>
  <li><strong style="color: #1abc9c;">Consistent Uploads:</strong> She uploaded a new product every week for 6 months straight.</li>
</ul>

<h2 style="color: #c0392b;">💸 Now She Makes $10,000/Month</h2>
<p>Sarah’s store now brings in over <strong style="color: #2ecc71;">$10K/month in passive income</strong>. She even started a second Etsy shop for wedding templates – all designed in Canva.</p>

<p>What’s her advice? <strong style="color: #f39c12;">“Just start. Even if it’s ugly. You’ll improve fast and your shop will grow.”</strong></p>
