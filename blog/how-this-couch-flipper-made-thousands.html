    <h1>How This Couch Flipper Made Thousands With Just a Pickup Truck and Hustle</h1>
  </header>

  <article>
    <p><strong>Meet Jordan.</strong> A few years ago, he was broke, recently laid off, and scrolling through Craigslist when he stumbled on a beat-up free couch. Instead of passing it by, he cleaned it, patched a tear, and flipped it for $125. That small win sparked something big.</p>

    <p>Jordan started picking up <strong>free or low-cost furniture</strong> every weekend—couches, chairs, and loveseats. With a little cleaning, some DIY fixes, and smart staging, he was flipping each one for 3–5x what he paid. Within six months, he was making <strong>$3,000–$5,000/month</strong> consistently—all while working from his garage.</p>

    <p>He marketed on Facebook Marketplace, Craigslist, and OfferUp. He learned what styles sold fast, what neighborhoods had the best pickups, and how to clean furniture professionally.</p>

    <p>“People throw away value every day,” Jordan said. “Most just don’t have the time or transportation. I found my niche and turned it into real money.”</p>

    <h2 style="color: #00ffae;">How You Can Start Couch Flipping Today:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>✔️ Look for free couches on Craigslist and Facebook Marketplace.</li>
      <li>✔️ Invest in a fabric cleaner, staple gun, and simple tools.</li>
      <li>✔️ Take high-quality photos and stage them nicely in listings.</li>
      <li>✔️ Deliver locally to maximize sales and value.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>If you’ve got a truck, some hustle, and an eye for design, <strong>couch flipping can change your life.</strong> And best of all? It doesn’t take a ton of money to start—just effort and strategy.</p>
