    <h1>How Marcus Made $2,400 in a Week Using TikTok Shop</h1>
  </header>

  <article>
    <p><strong>Marcus wasn’t a “guru.” He was just a 22-year-old with an iPhone and a ring light.</strong></p>

    <p>He kept seeing videos about <strong>TikTok Shop</strong> — the new way to sell products directly inside the app. With no upfront cost and insane viral reach, it sounded too good to ignore.</p>

    <h2>What Is TikTok Shop?</h2>
    <p><strong>TikTok Shop</strong> is a built-in ecommerce tool that lets creators promote and sell products straight from their videos — no website needed. Viewers click the product link while watching and check out in-app.</p>

    <h2>Marcus’s Strategy (That Anyone Can Copy):</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>🔎 Researched viral products on TikTok Shop (think: mini projectors, sunset lamps, ice rollers)</li>
      <li>🎥 Made short, relatable videos using trending sounds + emotional hooks</li>
      <li>🛒 Joined as a TikTok Shop <strong>affiliate</strong> (no need to buy inventory)</li>
      <li>📈 Dropped 2-3 videos per day — one hit 200K views in 48 hours</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>The result?</strong> Over $2,400 in commissions in 7 days — with no inventory, no shipping, just content.</p>

    <h2>Why TikTok Shop Works in 2025</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>📦 Easy to start — you can be an affiliate or seller</li>
      <li>🔥 Viral-friendly platform (product videos are pushed HARD)</li>
      <li>💰 You get paid per sale — and it stacks fast</li>
      <li>👀 Gen Z and Millennials trust TikTok over Amazon for discovery</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Quick Tips If You’re Starting Now:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Use trending sounds, fast edits, and “watch to the end” hooks</li>
      <li>Focus on visually satisfying products or ones with emotional value</li>
      <li>Keep descriptions clean, and call out benefits fast ("Look what this did to my skin…")</li>
      <li>Post 3–4x/day for 7 days — test and learn</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>You don’t need a following.</strong> Marcus started with 122 followers. TikTok Shop rewards content, not clout.</p>

    <p>If you're looking for a side hustle that works TODAY, <strong>TikTok Shop</strong> is that lane. Whether you're an affiliate or want to dropship your own products, it’s one of the fastest ways to go from $0 to real cash — with nothing but your phone.</p>

    <p><strong>The Rich Click</strong> will keep breaking down what’s hot. Ready to launch? Try it. Post. Learn. Repeat.</p>
