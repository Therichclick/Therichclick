    <h1>How This Hustler Made $3K/Month with Airbnb Arbitrage</h1>
  </header>

  <article>
    <p><strong>Chris didn’t have credit. He didn’t own a property. But he found a loophole.</strong></p>

    <p>He was scrolling TikTok when he found something called <strong>Airbnb rental arbitrage</strong> — renting an apartment long-term, furnishing it, and subletting it on Airbnb for short stays. It sounded illegal… until he learned how to do it right.</p>

    <h2>What Is Airbnb Arbitrage?</h2>
    <p>It’s simple: you lease a property, get the landlord’s permission in writing to sublease on Airbnb, and then turn it into a short-term rental business. You don’t need to own real estate — just hustle.</p>

    <h2>How Chris Made His First $3,000 Profit</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>🔑 He found a 1-bedroom in Atlanta for $1,250/month</li>
      <li>🛋️ Spent $800 furnishing it (Facebook Marketplace, IKEA)</li>
      <li>📝 Got landlord permission using a rental agreement template</li>
      <li>📸 Took clean, pro-style photos with his iPhone</li>
      <li>📅 Listed it on Airbnb and priced it at $110/night</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Result:</strong> 24 bookings in his first month = $4,680 gross. After rent + cleaning + supplies, he cleared **$3,020 profit**.</p>

    <h2>Why This Works in 2025:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>🌆 High demand in cities with business travelers & remote workers</li>
      <li>📉 Many landlords have empty units — they’re open to creative deals</li>
      <li>📲 Airbnb automates most of the work — easy to manage with apps</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Today, Chris has 4 units cash-flowing $2–4K/month each — all rented. No mortgage. No huge down payment. Just <strong>Airbnb + strategy + grind.</strong></p>

    <h2>Want to Try This Side Hustle?</h2>
    <p>Start small. Look for landlords on Zillow or Facebook Marketplace who are open-minded. Be upfront and professional. Offer higher security deposits or a co-hosting setup.</p>

    <p><strong>This is the fastest way to get into real estate without buying real estate.</strong> Airbnb arbitrage is no longer a secret — but most people are too scared to ask landlords. That’s where YOU win.</p>
