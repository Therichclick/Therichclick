    <h1>How This Creator Used Free AI Tools to Make $1,400 in a Week</h1>
  </header>

  <article>
    <p><strong>Meet Jay.</strong> He wasn’t a coder. He didn’t own a business. But he had one thing: curiosity about AI.</p>

    <p>In January, Jay started playing with <strong>free AI tools</strong> like ChatGPT, Midjourney, and CapCut. He noticed a trend: small businesses and content creators were <strong>desperate for fast, creative content.</strong> That’s when the lightbulb went off 💡.</p>

    <p><strong>His idea?</strong> Offer short AI-generated content for YouTubers and TikTok creators — <strong>intros, captions, scripts, thumbnails, or even full reels</strong> using AI tools.</p>

    <h2>How He Made His First $1,400</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>🎯 He posted a gig on Fiverr: “I’ll make 3 viral short videos using AI.”</li>
      <li>🎯 He offered a $10 starter pack and overdelivered using free tools.</li>
      <li>🎯 His 3rd client ordered a $200 package after one $10 sample.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Within a week, Jay had 20 orders — <strong>all created with ChatGPT, Midjourney, and Canva</strong>.</p>

    <p>He used ChatGPT for scriptwriting, Midjourney for visuals, and free CapCut templates to bring them to life.</p>

    <p><strong>And the best part?</strong> He never used his own voice or face. Just tools + creativity = cash.</p>

    <h2>Why AI Side Hustles Are Booming:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>🚀 AI handles the heavy lifting — writing, visuals, editing</li>
      <li>💸 No upfront investment required (use free plans)</li>
      <li>📈 Demand is exploding for AI-enhanced content</li>
      <li>🧠 You get smarter with each project — fast learning curve</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Jay now runs a one-man content agency from his laptop, hitting consistent $1–2K weeks. All he did was <strong>learn how to use free AI tools better than the average person</strong> and offer it as a service.</p>

    <p><strong>You don’t need a degree. You don’t need money. You just need time, hustle, and the right angle.</strong></p>
